1.	How do I approach designing software?

o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It help me to craft a tv, ice cream, a speaker and even a Starbucks cup

o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an image I took and then added my own twist to it

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I would be able to think outside the box and really take my time on fixing my work

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Once I discovered how to use textures and lighting it was game changer

o	How did iteration factor into your development?
That it had to be realistic that it would fit somewhere in a room

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I worked on it everyday and when something didn’t work I would take a break from it and come back to it later

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
If someone ever needs me to code a shape or make a logo in 3D I would be able to do that for them

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
If I do come across this in my field I wont be shocked or baffle by it since I know what im looking for and how to approach it.
